Mesh Generation
===============

`discretize` provides a numerical grid (or "mesh") on which to solve differential
equations. Each mesh type has a similar API to make working with
different meshes relatively simple. Within `discretize`, all meshes are
classes that have properties like the number of cells `nC`, and methods,
like `plotGrid`.

To learn how to create meshes with `discretize`, we have provided a set
of tutorials. These tutorials aim to teach the user:

	- where discrete variables can live on meshes
	- how to construct various types of meshes
	- how to extract useful properties from mesh objects
	- some aspects of plotting and meshes
